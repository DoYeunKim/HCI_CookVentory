1,"convenient, unpredictable, intuitive, practical","impressive, slow, intuitive, unpredictable",Great Start! I could see myself using this in the future when I start relying on myself for food and can just find a recipe for whatever is going off expiration date. 1: ingredient searching needs more work in that my input doesn't always produce an option in the results. 2: barcode scanning does not work for anything but pasta. Would be useful in the US where most stuff is barcoded.
1,"unpredictable, responsive, inefficient, convenient","satisfying, responsive, convenient, practical",SuperCook was okay couldn't really find 2 of the ingredient so I had look for things that was close to them. CookVentory was pretty straightforward and simple. 
1,"practical, intuitive, consistent, unpredictable","practical, reliable, intuitive, impressive","SuperCook was a bit challenging at first, and ultimately I only found 1 useful recipe. However CookVentory was very easy and reliable, as I found several recipes quickly. "
1,"slow, intuitive, stressful, practical","intuitive, satisfying, impressive, responsive","The first app (SuperCook) took me a little longer to figure out than the second one but wasn't that hard to figure out anyways. I also notice it was very slow and made it kind of stressful. The second app I thought was so dope, and it was extremely easy to use. My one complaint however was that I couldn't do anything past scanning. the ingredients unless that's all it's meant to do. "
1,"confusing, stressful, practical, slow","satisfying, convenient, impressive, reliable","(SuperCook) A bit frustrating b/c the ingredients didn't show up when typing them in, The categories were also very limited. It didn't help in terms of finding relevant recipes. (CookVentory) Super cool and efficient because the bar codes were able to pull up exact ingredient. So much easier and convenient. "
1,"slow, intuitive, stressful, practical","responsive, satisfying, practical, intuitive",SuperCook was hard to navigate and typing in was not usable for salt and pepper and was even hard to find under categories. CookVentory was much easier to use the picture function and was more user friendly.
1,"inefficient, slow, convenient, unpredictable","impressive, confusing, stressful, inefficient",CookVentory's scanning was really cool but once it showed me recipes I wasn't really sure what to do. Clicking on recipes didn't do anything. SuperCook needs to have boarder search. Red pepper flakes should equal crushed red p. 
1,"confusing, unpredictable, stressful, practical","confusing, impressive, unpredictable, practical","I was a little confused throughout the process, The first app didn't have the ingredients that I had. That took a lot of time trying to figure out how that worked, The second app was less stressful. I took pictures in my pantry and it showed up in my top picks."
1,"irrelevant, responsive, inefficient, distracting","reliable, convenient, practical, satisfying","SuperCook overall did not contain enough possible ingredient to actually create a dish with pasta. I would have preferred it to use all or most of the ingredients. I like that it redirected. I really like CookVentory and it is satisfying to scan, The only thing is I wish it also redirected to a site with the recipes. "
1,"distracting, intuitive, satisfying, consistent","impressive, confusing, unpredictable, busy","Although SuperCook is a little old-school, it tell you which ingredient from a recipe you're missing and it is easier to use. CookVentory is very cool and looks like the next and better version. My problem with it, is that I don't know that I'm missing from a recipe and when I input the bar if the ingredient it sometimes reads the bar 2 or 3 times at one go and sometimes it doesn't read it all. But great job!  "
1,"slow, stressful, irrelevant, inefficient","confusing, convenient, satisfying, responsive",SuperCook is a useless app that I would undownload immediately. Frustrating and lacking basic ingredient inventory to draw from. CookVentory was confusing at first and as soon as I figured out the barcode function I was IN LOVE. Would download.  
1,"slow, confusing, unpredictable, stressful","intuitive, practical, stressful, unpredictable","SuperCook: They didn't even have salt as a option I could select. Like, come on! Overall, it has limited utility. CookVentory: Initial setup was initially impressive. Figured out quickly how to scan items. Flat surfaces were good, curved surfaces wouldn't scan. Phone died before I could do anything else with it. "
1,"practical, distracting, stressful, confusing","convenient, reliable, satisfying, impressive","Both were interesting apps. Me personally, not too patient or tech savvy so just scanning bar codes on CookVentory very quick and convenient. Much easier and user friendly. "
1,"unpredictable, practical, slow, irrelevant","reliable, responsive, impressive, satisfying","I had trouble with SuperCook in inputting my ingredient. I couldn't find salt & pepper in the list and my red pepper registered as fresh red pepper. The CookVentory app with its scanning feature was much faster and more convenient to use. However, I'm not sure if the pepper code got scanned properly."
1,"practical, confusing, convenient, slow","responsive, satisfying, unpredictable, convenient","1) Tried voice input first, but the phone was unresponsive. Tried text, but the list didn't pop up, so was confused. Tried voice again, couldn't tell when ingredient weren't in library other than if it just didn't add. Maybe error message would be nice. 2) Scanned very quickly. Satisfying when it worked, but tried scanning chips, gave me buzz but error message was at the bottom, which wasn't visible immediately. "
1,"convenient, practical, slow, confusing","intuitive, responsive, consistent, reliable","The second app (CookVentory) more responsive and quicker than the first. I liked that the first app (SuperCook)provided a list of ingredients still needed before clicking the link. The first app was easier to use than the second because of the various considerations it processed -- diet, meal type, etc. "
1,"practical, impressive, busy, inefficient","satisfying, responsive, convenient, impressive",SuperCook seemed like it would be confusing but the ?/Help Section was very helpful. I just found it frustrating I could only add ingredient that were already in the system. I was unsuccessful in adding 2 of my ingredients and could not find it through the categories. CookVentory seemed more innovative and fun. I like the idea of scanning ingredients but would be worried if my ingredients did not have barcodes because the search function didn't seem to work. I was also more vague than SuperCook
1,"intuitive, impressive, unpredictable, practical","unpredictable, stressful, confusing, slow","I couldn't find salt in SuperCook + the recipes it said would work for me were wrong. That said, I was super confused by CookVentory. I think I might have broken it by accident. In both cases, I was underwhelmed by the accuracy of the recipes given ( I couldn't look at them in CookVentory)."
2,"impressive, reliable, intuitive, convenient","confusing, responsive, consistent, irrelevant",I was very happy with the SuperCook app because it gave me many meal options. Whereas CookVentory app only gave me a few. 
2,"slow, busy, impressive, satisfying","confusing, inefficient, stressful, inefficient","I like how CookVentory was able to scan the bar code and give me recipes, but it would not let me open them. With SuperCook, I found it a little slow, but I was able to open the recipes. "
2,"busy, distracting, practical, convenient","practical, responsive, unpredictable, satisfying","I first tried CookVentory's? The Barcode scanner is really good at its job. It read barcode right away, but then it read it multiple times and the app freaked out (which is why I said unpredictable) but just restarted the app and it worked perfectly afterwards. SuperCook is a website... I did not like all the advertisements in the middle of my recipes. It seemed cluttered  (busy and distracting). I did however like that it listed the ingredients that I was missing. It also took me a bit longer to figure out how to use it. "
2,"irrelevant, inefficient, unpredictable, busy","reliable, intuitive, responsive, satisfying","CookVentory: great app. Only suggestion is to make the pics of the dishes more aesthetically consistent. Also some pics are missing for the ingredients. SuperCook: very slow to type the ingredient, And it does not recognize ingredients like ""black pepper"". Hard to spot the fridge icon. The result are irrelevant. And I can't see multiple dishes on one page. "
2,"inefficient, irrelevant, confusing, practical","impressive, convenient, satisfying, practical","I loved the barcode reader! That was so helpful and easy for CookVentory. Also, CookVentory would bringt up relevant recipes, but recipes included more ingredients that I had, SuperCook was fine, but it was slower and  could only select ingredients already in the app... I couldn't type in salt :( "

2,"slow, busy, intuitive, practical","intuitive, practical, responsive, convenient","I'm guessing the first task (CookVentory) is an improvement on the website in the second task (SuperCook). I like the layout of the app much better. Firstly, the look and feel is more natural. Secondly, there is no clutter from the ""missing ingredients"" listen on the website. I think that it would be good for anyone who wants to cook. Side note: barcode scanners w/o instructions are def not intuitive for older people, but I'm sure that is considered and will be instructions. "
2,"slow, convenient, distracting, confusing","convenient, intuitive, practical, confusing ","I had an overall good experience with CookVentory. I didn't not realize that CookVentory was the one you scan the barcode at first, so it took me a while to figure out how to input the ingredient. But once that was clear, the app becomes very easy to use. SuperCook is somewhat more confusing. I have very little experience with Samsung so when I input ""sea salt"" but nothing comes up. I thought that was because I'm not inputting correctly while in fact it's because there are not matches in the ingredient list. Also looking for ingredient in a long list could be difficult. "
2,"unpredictable, intuitive, practical, inconsistent","stressful, inefficient, confusing, irrelevant","SuperCook I understand what this app is doing. However, sometimes it's hard for me to find the right ingredient (not in the drop-down) or maybe I am just not familiar with the android keyboard. CookVentory: I don't quite understand what this app is doing. No matter what I tried to do, the app seemed unresponsive(tried taking photos and enter words with keyboard) The only thing I could see are ""top picks"" And even those are not responsive upon clicking. Overall it confuses me. But it's possible that I am just a terrible user. "

2,"consistent, slow, inefficient, satisfying","confusing, responsive, practical, stressful","I wish the app made it immediately clear how to all to the panty. Like for CookVentory, I got that you use the barcode and it was really good/responsive, but there was no notification that it was added to my pantry so I was confused. The second app was good (I saw the help icon and could read it, but it didn't have salt???)"
2,"confusing, slow, busy, convenient","confusing, satisfying, slow, convenient",Ingredient entry was hard to locate on both apps. Barcode scanning is cool but it double scanned twice for me --not was to delete the second one. Study: Felt like I should pick an even balance of positive and negative words for your app -- but maybe I'm biased since I know which one it is. 
2,"slow, stressful, inefficient, unpredictable","satisfying, intuitive, slow, consistent",I don't know what brand this gummy bear this is but it's good. Can't stop eating it. I thought the first app (CookVentory) was a lot better but what about items like onions and garlic without barcodes? 
2,"practical, intuitive, convenient, unpredictable","satisfying, practical, confusing, busy","CookVentory is unintuitive because it's not clear what you should do when you open the app. The pantry should be the first page opened and a pop-up should instruct you to put things in it, then find recipes, Also, the links to recipes don't work. SuperCook is much more intuitive, except: 1. It doesn't include salt and pepper as ingredients, and 2. doesn't say when it can't find your item. Also, I like how the recipe links work and that they tell you what you're missing -> include a link for add to shopping list? "
2,"slow, unpredictable, confusing, busy","confusing, responsive, reliable, consistent",It took me a little while to figure out CookVentory but then figuring out your could use barcodes made it much more efficient. 
2,"convenient, busy, unpredictable, slow","impressive, responsive, satisfying, convenient","CookVentory was cool. Error when more than 4? SuperCook was hard to use, slow and some of the ingredient didn't show up. "
1` ,"responsive, intuitive, inefficient, practical","confusing, practical, convenient, consistent","For SuperCook, could not use the salt, pepper, or crushed red pepper as ingredients. Same for CookVentory, could use the app for finding dishes that included linguine"
2` ,"unpredictable, slow, responsive, busy","confusing, inefficient, slow, distracting",Cookinventory wouldn't let me easily add ingredients and when I went to the settings nothing appeared to help user. SuperCook was better because you could go through the catalog but it wouldn't find typed ingredients.
1`,"slow, confusing, unpredictable, inefficient","inefficient, confusing, stressful, unpredictable","SuperCook: Why did it take me so long to find salt? I couldn't even find normal salt. I just had to put in celery salt. Also, the type ingredient search is inefficient, it doesn't recognize ingredients that me be called other things. CookVentory: I couldn't get this to work at all, there is no way to add ingredients to the inventory. I can't even click on recipes that are in the top picks. Also, there's a setting button that doesn't do anything. This makes SuperCook look good! "
